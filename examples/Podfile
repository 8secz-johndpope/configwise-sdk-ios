# TODO [smuravev] There is known issue if we run project on real device iOS v13.3.1 and above
#                 and only used 'personal team' (free apple development program) in 'Signing & Capabilities' settings
#                 of your project. This issue not exist if we use paid apple development account or if we run project
#                 on simulator. See more details about this issue in the following links:

#                 As a temporary workaround, we use `use_modular_headers!` instead of `use_frameworks!`
#                 Also, run `pod update`, then clean project in Xcode (CMD+SHIFT+K), then run project.
#                 After apple fixes this issue, we must continue use `use_frameworks!`, here.
#use_modular_headers!
